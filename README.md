This dataset looks at 14 different attributes of heart disease patients, and then includes a doctor's diagnosis of the severity of the patients heart disease on a scale of 0-4 (0 being none, 4 being very severe).

The algorithm then uses the data, along with the diagnosis to determinie what the most import factors are in a patient when it comes to heart disease. This is done by calculating each attributes information gain with respect to its parent, which in this case is the doctor's diagnosis.
